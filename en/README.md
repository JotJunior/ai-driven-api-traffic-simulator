## 1. Introduction

Modern microservices architectures require comprehensive observability solutions to ensure system reliability and performance. Traditional synthetic monitoring often fails to capture realistic user behavior patterns, leading to gaps in metrics collection and performance analysis. This paper documents an innovative approach to designing and planning a sophisticated API traffic simulator using AI-assisted architectural design.

### 1.1 Problem Statement

The challenge was to design a system capable of:
- Simulating realistic user traffic patterns against a REST API
- Generating meaningful metrics for observability dashboards
- Utilizing modern concurrency patterns for high-performance simulation
- Providing configurable load testing scenarios
- Integrating seamlessly with existing Prometheus/Grafana infrastructure

### 1.2 Initial Requirements Specification

The original prompt provided to the AI system was deliberately high-level and business-focused:

> *"Gostaria que fosse criado um script para simular acessos à API, criando usuários, perfis, navegando as listas etc. Mas não como um e2e, mas realizando posts reais simulando navegadores e tudo mais. O intuito é ter conteúdo para visualizar as métricas geradas no grafana. Daí seria criar um comando do Hyperf que faz uso das co-rotinas para executar chamadas paralelas. Pode ser um pré-stress test, só que mais suave, validando logins corretos e incorretos, acesso a todos os endpoints disponíveis, criando e usando diversos usuários com chamadas em tempos aleatórios. Enquanto o comando estiver em funcionamento, ele deve trabalhar esse comportamento. Um exemplo: php bin/hyperf.php user:populate --users=100 --min-request-count=10 --max-request-count=1000 onde seriam criados 100 usuários que executariam entre 10 e 1000 requisições na API."*

This prompt represents a typical scenario in software architecture: stakeholders understand the business need but require technical translation into actionable specifications.

## 2. AI-Assisted Architecture Design Methodology

### 2.1 Multi-Agent Approach

Rather than attempting to solve this complex problem with a single AI response, we employed a multi-agent approach utilizing specialized AI agents:

1. **Planner Agent**: Strategic planning and task orchestration
2. **System Architect Agent**: High-level architecture and enterprise patterns
3. **API Documentation Agent**: Endpoint mapping and technical specifications

This approach mirrors modern software development practices where specialized roles contribute to comprehensive solutions.

### 2.2 Iterative Refinement Process

The design process followed these iterative phases:

#### Phase 1: Requirements Analysis & Technical Specification
- **Input**: Business requirements in natural language
- **Process**: Translation to technical requirements and component identification
- **Output**: [Technical Specification Document](./user-traffic-simulator-spec.md)

#### Phase 2: Architecture Enhancement & Enterprise Patterns
- **Input**: Base technical specification
- **Process**: Application of enterprise patterns, scalability analysis, and performance optimization
- **Output**: [Architecture Enhancements Document](./traffic-simulator-architecture-enhancements.md)

#### Phase 3: API Surface Analysis & Endpoint Mapping
- **Input**: Existing codebase analysis
- **Process**: Comprehensive endpoint discovery, parameter mapping, and usage pattern analysis
- **Output**: [API Endpoint Mapping Document](./api-endpoint-mapping-for-traffic-simulator.md)

#### Phase 4: Implementation Planning & Consolidation

- **Process**: Project planning, milestone definition, and resource estimation
- **Output**: [Implementation Plan Document](./traffic-simulator-implementation-plan.md)

### 3.3 User Behavior Modeling

The system models four distinct user archetypes based on realistic usage patterns:

| User Type | Distribution | Request Range | Primary Behaviors |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|-------------------|
| New User | 20% | 10-30 | Registration, initial exploration |
| Active User | 50% | 30-100 | Standard CRUD operations |
| Administrative User | 20% | 50-200 | User management, bulk operations |
| Power User | 10% | 100-1000 | Intensive API usage, analytics |

This distribution reflects real-world application usage patterns and ensures comprehensive API coverage.
